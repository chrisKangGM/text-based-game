A basic text-based-game, that does not have any GUI. This game can only be played through a **Terminal**.
> Because this is a learn-by-coding project, ***no copy coding will be done.*** 🧐

## 🏁 Goal of this project 🏁
1. A **learn-by-coding** project to get more familiar about java.

2. To get used to using **Git** and **Github**.

3. To make a playable **output** that can keep track of my effort in **learning** java.
