# text-based-game
A basic text-based-game, that does not have any GUI.
The game is played using a terminal.

## Goal of this project
✍️ A **learn-by-coding** project to get more familiar about java.
📖 To get used to using **Git** and **Github**.
🎮 To make a playable **output** that can keep track of my effort in **learning** java.

because this is a learn-by-coding project, ***no copy coding will be done.***
Every code hand written by myself 😃
